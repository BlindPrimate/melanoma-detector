## Data Science Capstone Project
As a capstone project for my CS degree, this neural-network based melanoma detector was developed.  The ultimate goal was to create an app that would allow an image of a suspected melanoma to be uploaded to be diagnosed as potentially cancerous based on a trained DS model.

This project was built mostly with python and flask for the model and back-end work, and react for the front-end UI.

To build and run:

```
python install -r requirements.txt
```
and
```
webpack run dev
```
This will launch the development server and open a browser window with the application.
